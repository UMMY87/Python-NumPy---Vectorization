# Python-NumPy---Vectorization
This code snippet demonstrates various NumPy functionalities for array creation, indexing, and manipulation. It starts by importing NumPy and setting up some initializations. Then, it showcases different methods for creating arrays, such as `np.zeros`, `np.random.random_sample`, `np.arange`, and `np.array`. The code also illustrates vector indexing and slicing operations for 1-D and 2-D arrays, including accessing individual elements, rows, and slices of arrays. Additionally, it presents arithmetic operations on arrays and scalar values, along with the dot product computation using both custom and NumPy's built-in functions. Finally, the code covers reshaping arrays, indexing matrices, and slicing operations on 2-D arrays, providing a comprehensive overview of NumPy's capabilities for array manipulation and mathematical operations.
